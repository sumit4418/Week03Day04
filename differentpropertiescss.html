            <p>MongoDB — A NoSQL database
                Before getting to know about MongoDB, we have to know what a NoSQL database is and how it is different
                from
                the other popular database type SQL.</p>
            <p>NoSQL databases are called ‘non-relational’ databases whereas SQL databases are called relational
                databases
                because a table in the SQL database can be related to another table but in the case of a NoSQL database
                it
                doesn’t need to be so because it has its own to achieve what SQL does.</p>
                <p>An article on working with the CRUD operations and other utilities of the NoSQL database, the ‘MongoDB’.</p>
                <p>MongoDB is  enterprises and the latter is free and downloadable. So for the purpose.</p>

            <p>MongoDB is a widely used popular NoSQL database all over the world. Some of the other NoSQL databases are
                Redis, Cassandra, Apache CouchDB and the list go on.</p>
            <p>A database contains multiple tables and a particular table contains columns or fields and every row is a
                single data. In a SQL table, every data has the same schema, means once a table has been initialized
                then the data being inserted has to have all the fields depicted in the table, even if values for some
                fields are not present then those fields are filled in with the ‘NULL’ data.</p>
                <p>MongoDB is available as Enterprise and Community Server, where the former is paid and used for we will download and configure the Community Server edition. Please follow the previous link to download the.</p>
